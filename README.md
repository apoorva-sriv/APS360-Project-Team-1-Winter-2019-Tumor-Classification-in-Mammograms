# APS360 Project (Team 1 Winter 2019): Tumor Classification in Mammograms

Our final report, outlining the details of the project, can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QmWpsv7lmeYFcXUk-IvBumh6OVGO-Gy-4WufvhMICb8/edit?usp=sharing).

Our trained model weights are available [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/ckxyl8d8y3dd8/). To see which model the file name corresponds to, you will have to look at the output of the (third last) dateâ€“time cell in the Results PDFs.
